Run some tests with the pixel 6, 7p, Samsung note20 and the galaxy s21 ultra that max has, and the S21 is FAR superior to all other devices that I have tested.

With it you can actually track a somewhat unobstructed phone with little flickers through the whole hall
Max was actually able to get readings up to ~40m in both directions, with just the 3d anchor placed in front of Philip's office (up to the network lab/seminar room)

we have also tested aoa on his phone, with the 2d anchor lying in the cable trench, and at least 5m are VERY accurate, but under the trench it would probably be way better.
